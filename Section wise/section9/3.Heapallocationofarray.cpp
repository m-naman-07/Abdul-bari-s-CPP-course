/*
No, p[2], p[3], and p[4] will not automatically take zero as values. Instead, they will contain garbage values unless explicitly initialized.

Explanation:

    int* p = new int[5];
    p[0] = 2;
    p[1] = 3;
Only p[0] and p[1] are assigned.

The remaining elements (p[2], p[3], p[4]) will hold indeterminate (garbage) values.

This is because new int[5] does not zero-initialize by default.

‚úÖ How to zero-initialize:

    int* p = new int[5]();  // Note the parentheses

This will set all elements to 0.

‚úÖ Or use C++11 list initialization:

    int* p = new int[5]{0};  // Initializes all elements to 0

You can also partially initialize:

    int* p = new int[5]{2, 3};  // p[0]=2, p[1]=3, rest = 0

üî• Tip for Competitive Programming (CP):
Always initialize arrays if you rely on default values. Uninitialized variables can lead to unpredictable bugs and wrong answers.

No, you cannot directly initialize a dynamic array (int* p = new int[5];) using initializer list syntax like p = {1, 2}; ‚Äî that‚Äôs invalid in C++ and will give a compiler error.

‚ùå Invalid:

    int* p = new int[5];
    p = {1, 2};  // ‚ùå Error: invalid initializer

‚úÖ Correct way: Initialize manually

    int* p = new int[5];
    p[0] = 1;
    p[1] = 2;
    p[2] = 3;
    p[3] = 4;
    p[4] = 5;

‚úÖ Alternative (C++11 and above): Use std::vector
If you want easy initialization, prefer std::vector:

    #include <vector>
    std::vector<int> p = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
You get:
 - Bounds safety
 - Auto memory management
 - Easy initialization



            
In C++, you must use delete[] p;, not delete p[];.

‚úÖ Correct:

    int* p = new int[5];  // allocate array of 5 ints
    delete[] p;           // correct way to delete array

‚ùå Incorrect:

    delete p[];   // ‚ùå syntax error ‚Äî invalid C++ syntax

You‚Äôll get a compiler error with delete p[]; because it's not a valid statement in C++.

‚ö†Ô∏è Why delete[]?
 - When you use new[], it allocates an array on the heap.
 - So, you must use delete[] to properly deallocate all elements of that array.
 - If you use just delete p;, only the first element is destroyed causing memory leaks.
