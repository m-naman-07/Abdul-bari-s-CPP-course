/*
Duplicates in Search
searching is done in unique list of elements.
If there are duplicates we can‚Äôt perform search.
If they are duplicates then you should look for all occurrences of a
element.
Example:
List : 8,5,7,8,10,8,2,7,8
Here 8 is appearing 4 time. If you search for 8, then which 8 you
want?

üß† Problem Recap:
You're given a list (possibly unsorted) with duplicates, like:

    List: 8, 5, 7, 8, 10, 8, 2, 7, 8
If someone says:
"Search for 8"
We face the question:

"Which one?"
First occurrence?
All occurrences?
Last occurrence?

So in duplicate-friendly lists, a single ‚Äúsearch‚Äù isn‚Äôt enough unless you know what you want.

‚úÖ 1. First Occurrence

    int index = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (arr[i] == key) {
            index = i;
            break; // exit loop after first match
        }
    }
Use this when you only care where the key starts.

‚úÖ 2. All Occurrences

    vector<int> indices;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (arr[i] == key) {
            indices.push_back(i);
        }
    }

This is useful when you want to find all positions of a value.

In CP, it helps when you‚Äôre solving frequency or matching problems.

‚úÖ 3. Count Occurrences

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (arr[i] == key)
            ++count;
    }

Useful when solving problems like:

"Check if a number appears more than k times"

‚úÖ 4. Last Occurrence
Just continue scanning, and overwrite index on each match:

    int index = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (arr[i] == key)
            index = i;
    }
üî• For Sorted Arrays (Duplicates + Binary Search)
Use std::lower_bound and std::upper_bound:

    #include <algorithm>  // Required for lower_bound, upper_bound

    int* first = std::lower_bound(arr, arr+n, key);  // first occurrence
    int* last = std::upper_bound(arr, arr+n, key);   // just after last

    int count = last - first;  // number of occurrences

‚úÖ Works in O(log n) for sorted arrays
